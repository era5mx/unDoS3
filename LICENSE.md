# License

I am not related to the original utility developed by Barry Shteiman (https://www.linkedin.com/in/barryshteiman/) for Python 2.x.

There is no reference to the license of the original utility in the original source. Ask the author of the original utility about the license.

However, I believe that it is a simple and short code, which can be in the public domain, which is why I chose to offer this version of the script under a Creative Commons license.
